# Core Keeper Editor Kit

Small extension that allows for uploading mods to mod.io.

## How to use

1. Create 2 files somewhere on your pc outside your project folder for safety. 1 containing your ApiKey and 1 containing your Auth Token. 
2. Add both files in the settings menu of ThunderKit.
3. Add a ModIoData ManifestDatum to the manifest of the mod you want to upload. 
4. Add the ModIoUpload pipeline to be able to execute it.
